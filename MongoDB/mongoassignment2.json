Atlanta Population:
//use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA.
db.zipcode.find({city:"ATLANTA", state: "GA"})
//use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$match: {city:"ATLANTA", state: "GA"}}])
//use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta.
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$match:{city:"ATLANTA"}},{$group:{_id:"$city", count:{$sum: 1}}}])
//use $group to find the total population in Atlanta.
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$match:{city:"ATLANTA"}},{$group:{_id:"$city", count:{$sum:"$pop"}}}])

Populations By State:
//use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state.
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$state", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}])
//sort the results by population, highest first
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$state", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}, {$sort:{TotPopulation:-1}}])
//limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$state", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}, {$sort:{TotPopulation:-1}}, {$limit: 3}])

Populations by City
//use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { city: '$city', state: '$state' }
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$city", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}])
//sort the results by population, highest first
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$city", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}, {$sort:{TotPopulation:-1}}])
//limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in population?
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$city", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}, {$sort:{TotPopulation:-1}}, {$limit: 3}])
//What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas?
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$match:{state:"TX"}},{$group:{_id:"$city", TotPopulation:{$sum:"$pop"}}}, {$sort:{TotPopulation:-1}}, {$limit: 3}])

Bonus
//Write a query to get the average city population for each state.
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$state", AvgPopulation:{$avg:"$pop"}}}])
//What are the top 3 states in terms of average city population?
db.zipcode.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$state", AvgPopulation:{$avg:"$pop"}}}, {$sort:{AvgPopulation:-1}}, {$limit: 3}])
