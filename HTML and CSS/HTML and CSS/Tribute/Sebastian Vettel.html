                About the Legend
            </h1>
 
             
 
<p>
                ☛ Born and raised a Bull, then a Prancing Horse, and now the face of Aston Martin’s Formula 1 revival, F1's poster boy of early achievement had won more than all but two drivers in history by the time he      was just 26, including back-to-back world titles between 2010 and 2013.
<br>           
<br>
                ☛ Vettel’s trademark is pure pace – and of course his one-finger victory salute. In the chase to the chequered flag, he likes to lead from the front and just like his hero, Michael Schumacher. But for all      his competitive streak, Vettel has a playful side too and has been known to let loose with a spot of Beatles karaoke - and baby can he drive a car.
<br><br>
                ☛ Alongside his four world crowns he can boast more than 50 pole positions and race victories, ranking him – statistically - above many of the biggest names in F1 history. No wonder then that he has twice      been hand-picked to return some of Grand Prix oldest names to glory.  
    
<br><br> <img src="./Sebastian Vettel_files/abc.gif" class="center" style="float:left;width:100%;height:450px;"  alt="Error Loading Image"><br>
                ☛ Vettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the "Baby Schumi". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration    and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the "New Vettel". 
    
<br><br> <img src="./Sebastian Vettel_files/vettel-f1.gif" class="center" style="float:left;width:100%;height:450px;"  alt="Error Loading Image"><br>
    <br>
                ☛ Following his move to Maranello, that mission didn’t exactly go to plan as Vettel’s rivalry with Lewis Hamilton intensified. Then came an additional thorn in his side – young-gun Ferrari team mate Charles    Leclerc, the first man to outscore him over a season at the Scuderia.
<br><br><img src="./Sebastian Vettel_files/Sebastian-Vettel.gif" class="center" style="float:left;width:100%;height:450px;"  alt="Error Loading Image"><br> 
                ☛ His latest challenge is as Aston Martin’s team leader. He has already put them on the podium, but Vettel will need to call on all his speed and experience if he’s to regularly reassert himself over his      rivals – and re-establish his reputation as one of the sport’s all-time greats.

<br><br> 
                ☛ Vettel has demonstrated an interest in the environment and other social justice issues. Following the 2021 British Grand Prix, he helped remove litter from the stands, and he also worked with                children in Austria to build a hotel for bees.
<br><br>
                ☛ Furthermore, Vettel has been critical of how F1 races are scheduled, stating that races that are geographically proximate to each other should be held on consecutive weekends to reduce emissions from        travelling.
<br><br> 
                ☛ He also held an all-women karting event during the weekend of the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and donned the pride flag at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix despite being reprimanded.
<br><br> 
                ☛ Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Vettel expressed an intent to boycott the September's Russian Grand Prix should the race go as planned.
    
<br><br> 
                ☛ Vettel was named Rookie of the Year at the annual Autosport Awards in 2008. In 2009, Vettel was awarded the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy, for his achievements in the 2008 season. He was also awarded the 2009      British Racing Drivers' Club Johnny Wakefield Trophy for "setting the fastest race lap of the season on the Silverstone Grand Prix Circuit"
<br><br>
                ☛Vettel was also voted Formula One driver of the year in 2009, 2011 and 2013 by the team principals, initiated by the Autosport magazine. He additionally won the DHL Fastest Lap Award in 2009, 2012 and 2013. He became European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association in 2010, and by the Polish Press Agency in 2012 and 2013. Furthermore, Vettel was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 2013. In 2014, he was named Sportsman of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards. In 2015, he received the Confartigianato Motori Award for Driver of the Year.
